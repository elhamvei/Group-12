DevOps SDLC 
(software develpment life cycle).

6 software development life cycle models: 
1. Agile 
2. Lean 
3. Waterfall
4. Iterative 
5. Spiral
6. DevOps

1. Agile: 
    The Agile model first emerged in 
    2001 and has since become t
    he de facto industry standard. 

2. Lean: 
   The Lean model for 
   software development is 
   inspired by "lean" manufacturing
    practices and principles. 

3. Waterfall: 
    Some experts argue that the Waterfall 
    model was never meant to be a process 
    model for real projects.

4. Iterative: 
    The Iterative model is repetition 
    incarnate. Instead of starting with 
    fully known requirements, project 
    teams implement a set of software 
    requirements, then test, evaluate 
    and pinpoint further requirements. 

5. Spiral:
    One of the most flexible SDLC methodologies, 
    Spiral takes a cue from the Iterative model 
    and its repetition. 

6. DevOps:
    The DevOps methodology is a relative 
    newcomer to the SDLC scene. 
    It emerged from two trends: 
    the application of Agile and Lean 
    practices to operations work, and 
    the general shift in business toward
     seeing the value of collaboration 
     between development and operations 
     staff at all stages of the SDLC 
     process.

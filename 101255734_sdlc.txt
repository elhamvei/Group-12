DevOps SDLC 
(software develpment life cycle).

6 software development life cycle models: 
1. Agile 
2. Lean 
3. Waterfall
4. Iterative 
5. Spiral
6. DevOps

1. Agile: 
    The Agile model first emerged in 
    2001 and has since become t
    he de facto industry standard. 

2. Lean: 
   The Lean model for 
   software development is 
   inspired by "lean" manufacturing
    practices and principles. 

3. Waterfall: 
    Some experts argue that the Waterfall 
    model was never meant to be a process 
    model for real projects.

4. Iterative: 
    The Iterative model is repetition 
    incarnate. Instead of starting with 
    fully known requirements, project 
    teams implement a set of software 
    requirements, then test, evaluate 
    and pinpoint further requirements. 

5. Spiral:
    One of the most flexible SDLC methodologies, 
    Spiral takes a cue from the Iterative model 
    and its repetition.

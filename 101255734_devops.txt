DevOps
 (a portmanteau of “development” 
 and “operations”) is the combination 
 of practices and tools designed to 
 increase an organization's ability to
 deliver applications and services 
 faster than traditional software 
 development processes.

 The DevOps model enables 
 your developers and 
 operations teams to achieve 
 these results.

DevOps
 (a portmanteau of “development” 
 and “operations”) is the combination 
 of practices and tools designed to 
 increase an organization's ability to
 deliver applications and services 
 faster than traditional software 
 development processes.

 The DevOps model enables 
 your developers and 
 operations teams to achieve 
 these results.

 Amazon Web Services describes DevOps as 
 the combination of cultural philosophies, 
 practices, and tools that increases an 
 organization’s ability to deliver applications 
 and services at high velocity, evolving and 
 improving products at a faster pace than organizations 
 using traditional software development and infrastructure 
 management processes.

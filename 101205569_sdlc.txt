A DevOps engineer should have the ability to design, 
provision, and manage computer ecosystems, whether 
on-premise or in the cloud. Itâ€™s important to 
understand Infrastructure as Code (IaC), 
an IT management process that applies best 
practices from DevOps software development to 
the management of cloud infrastructure resources.
